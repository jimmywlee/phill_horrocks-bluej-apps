//START ROOM
description =  
"You awake, groggily, your vision blurred, eyes rolling around.\n"+
"The piercing wailing of the ship’s alarm system is bringing\n"+
"you round faster than your concussion would like. “WARNING: HULL\n"+
"BREACH. WARNING: HULL BREACH. LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS CRITICAL.\n"+
"APPROXIMATE TIME TO OXYGEN DEPLETION 3 MINUTES”. Your eyes\n"+
"make out the flashing of the alarm lights and the warning\n"+
"messages flashing on the ship’s main console. There is a\n"+
"clock on the console, counting down the minutes. You pick\n"+
"yourself up and manage to stagger to the ship’s console and\n"+
"turn off the cacophonous noise of the alarm. Slowly, eye’s\n"+
"still going in and out of focus, you bring up the ship’s\n"+
"schematic and damage report on the computer. The damage report\n"+
"states that the ship's quarters have sustained critical\n"+
"damage and no life forms are being reported. Your crew is gone.\n"+
"Just then, your suit reports a critical oxygen leak - your\n"+
"oxygen tank has taken damage and is losing pressure fast.\n"+
"The suit damage report states you have less than 2 minutes of\n"+
"oxygen remaining. You realise you don’t have enough oxygen to\n"+
"make it to the escape pod in time, unless of course you can\n"+
"find replacement oxygen… and fast. Your only way out is north\n"+
"to the navigation room. In the corner is an empty oxygen tank";



// STAFFROOM
description = 
"in the staff room, chairs and tables are strewn around everywhere\n"+
"making navigation difficult. There are a number of garments laying\n"+
"around and in the corner, one in particular catches your eye, the\n"+
"name tag reading Stark. Captain Stark’s jacket has a small key marked\n"+
"'LAUNCH' in the chest pocket. The rest of the room seems to contain\n"+
"nothing useful as you watch the timer tick down on the console screen\n"+
"above, you decide you must act fast.";


//ELECTRICAL
description = 
"in the electrical room, wires and steam currently block your path\n"+
"back to the main ship but you see the engine room has been burst open,\n"+
"possibly by one of your crewmates before they deserted the ship.";


//MOBILE SERVICE SYSTEM
description =  
"in the Mobile Service System, normally, this is a dedicated area for\n"+
"launching satellites into orbit or repairing damaged space vehicles.\n"+
"Now, the arm which normally does this is broken and laying on its side\n"+
"with its main manipulator torn off. There is nothing of use here";


//COMMUNICATIONS
description = 
"in the communications room it is surprisingly unaffected by the\n"+
"catastrophic event now signalling your death. Around the room\n"+
"there are the now familiar console warnings and flashing red\n"+
"alarm lights. Over near the main comms console you can see a\n"+
"terminal which looks unlike the others. ";


//MEDBAY
description = 
"in the medbay, medical computers, beds and equipment are in complete\n"+
"disarray with the rooms various cupboards and storage contents emptied\n"+
"everywhere. Through the mess, you can spot the emergency door to the\n"+
"engine room, which is currently open with steam and sparks emitting from\n"+
"the broken systems that lie beyond. On top of one of the upturned beds,\n"+
"you can just make out the top of what looks like a yellow oxygen tank.\n"+
"On the floor you spot an oxygen outlet";


//ENGINE ROOM
description = 
"in the ship’s engine room. Here, the power source of the ship’s\n"+
"propulsion system lies exposed, dangerously emitting arcs of\n"+
"electricity between the core and the hull of the ship. Steam and\n"+
"sparks are everywhere. There is no chance of repairing the warp\n"+
"core as it’s too badly damaged. Time is running out and the warnings\n"+
"are now showing ‘SYSTEMS CRITICAL’ on the engine room consoles...\n"+
"There is a door marked 'Emergency Escape This Way' but the door which\n"+
"which is normally open has been security locked and the door control\n"+
"is asking for a passkey... Beyond the door you can see ladders\n"+
"descending into the darkness...";


//VENTILLATION SHAFT
description = 
"descending the ladders, you pathway is blocked and your only way\n"+
"out is to go through a small ventillation shaft just behind you.\n"+
"The shaft is claustrophic and the oxygen tank rattles and scrapes\n"+
"its way along with you. Up ahead you can make out flashing red\n"+
"alarm lights again.";


//CORRIDOR
description = 
"in a corridor heading towards the main ship's reactor. The path to the\n"+
"ladders ascending to the main parts of the ship are blocked at the\n"+
"bottom, and your only way back is to the vent or to the reactor. Steam\n"+
"and sparks fill the corridor making movement tricky. The faint voice of\n"+
"the ship's computer once again announces that the ship systems are failing\n"+
"and that crew members much abandon ship immediatly";


//AIRLOCK - DIE
description = 
"You enter the ships airlock. Normally this is a safe area. However,\n"+
"the ship's systems have been badly damaged and you find that the door\n"+
"closes behind you. You press and press the control panel but it does\n"+
"not respond. You cannot get back in. Your oxygen depletes and you die\n"+
"a slow, cold agonising a death trapped in the airlock";


//AIRLOCK - SURVIVE
description = 
"Today is your lucky day - normally, you'd have died a painful, cold\n"+
"death in the icy grip of deep space, but, you had the good foresight\n"+
"to collect the door key in the vent. You quickly notice the key colour\n"+
"is the same as the airlock and you thrust the card into the reader.\n"+
"You haul youself through the door and to safety. The door closes.";


//DAMAGED POD
description = 
"in the second escape pod. It has been critically damaged and it's nose\n"+
"has almost entirely been smashed off by high-speed debris. None of the\n"+
"systems are operational - there is no chance of escape in this pod.";


//PRIMARY POD
description = 
"in the Escape Pod. This is, by comparison to the rest of the ship,\n"+
"is in unmarked condition and all of its systems seem to be intact.\n"+
"Looking around, there are two pilot seats and enough extra seating\n"+
"in the rear for 10 crew members to safely escape. You can see that\n"+
"the computer is expecting an access key in order to engage and authorise\n"+
"the launch sequence. You don’t have much time left. You must activate\n"+
"the LAUNCH sequence in order to escape.";
