 You are carrying: nothing!
 You are  inside the ship's navigation room

 You are You awake, groggily, your vision blurred, eyes rolling around.
The piercing wailing of the ship’s alarm system is bringing
you round faster than your concussion would like. “WARNING: HULL
BREACH. WARNING: HULL BREACH. LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS CRITICAL.
APPROXIMATE TIME TO OXYGEN DEPLETION 3 MINUTES”. Your eyes
make out the flashing of the alarm lights and the warning
messages flashing on the ship’s main console. There is a
clock on the console, counting down the minutes. You pick
yourself up and manage to stagger to the ship’s console and
turn off the cacophonous noise of the alarm. Slowly, eye’s
still going in and out of focus, you bring up the ship’s
schematic and damage report on the computer. The damage report
states that the ship's quarters have sustained critical
damage and no life forms are being reported. Your crew is gone.
Just then, your suit reports a critical oxygen leak - your
oxygen tank has taken damage and is losing pressure fast.
The suit damage report states you have less than 2 minutes of
oxygen remaining. You realise you don’t have enough oxygen to
make it to the escape pod in time, unless of course you can
find replacement oxygen… and fast. Your only way out is north
to the navigation room. In the corner is an empty oxygen tank.

around and in the corner, one in particular catches your eye, the
name tag reading Stark. Captain Stark’s jacket has a small key marked
'LAUNCH' in the chest pocket. The rest of the room seems to contain
nothing useful as you watch the timer tick down on the console screen
above, you decide you must act fast..

 There is a passkey marked Engine Room here.
